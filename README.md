This repository hosts the R code and documentation files that are needed for the Data Science's track course - "Getting and Cleaning data"
as part of final assignment Week4

## The Following are the files posted to run the project:

1. `CodeBook.md` which describes the following activities :
     (a). how to use the inputs given to complete the project.
     (b). variables used in the code.
     (c). the data used for which the code is written.
     (d). any such transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data thereof.

2. The Rscript submitted for the project, `run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps as per the instructions given in the assignment. They can be launched by importing the file in RStudio and running the code with the run button found in the right hand titlebar of the Rscript console.
